# You are getting a source code. I trust you, so I expect it from you too. Keep your honor, do not share it, leak it or whatever you do it. Do not be a fucker as other leakers. This resource is only for you, not anyone else. Only you and your server as the right to use it. Everyone, do not rename it, resell it, republish it, claim it as yours or take any credits of it - if you do so, there is 11:10 chace of your server being blocked out of FiveM platform and I will DMCA this script out of your page/Discord/GitHub and whatever you will choose to do with this "illegaly". Namely: Majkkyware, please, do not rename it and resell it ðŸ˜‰ and you, Cryzysek, remember, the switchjob is not yours despite you renamed it as yours and took it as yours. ðŸ˜‰. Thank you for not being a retard who is not liked by anyone.

## Instalation:
```
1) Put `ensure sqz_duty` to your start config and resource called `sqz_duty` into your resources folder
2) Run the SQL file
3) Configure s_config.lua & sh_config.lua
```
## Optional modifications:
To add the duty element to your boss menu:
```
Change this:    local elements = {} in esx_society/client/main.lua:77 to
                local elements = {
                    {label = 'Show Duty Time of employees', value = 'dutyTime'}
                }
        Add the part bellow to line 168 (the end of the if condition)
        elseif data.current.value == 'dutyTime' then
			TriggerServerEvent('sqz_duty:GetEmployes', ESX.PlayerData.job.name)
```
## Events used:
1. `TriggerServerEvent('sqz_duty:GetEmployes', ESX.PlayerData.job.name)` Event for opening boss menu with time of players. Make sure you provide the job which maches xPlayer.job.name on server
2. `TriggerServerEvent('sqz_duty:ResetTime', identifier, ESX.PlayerData.job.name)` Event for reseting player time spent on server in the job, identifier should match targets xPlayer.identifier and the second argument is job name.
3. `TriggerServerEvent('sqz_duty:ChangeJob')` Event for changing job (mainly off <=> non off and if you have special job in Config, it will count on it with it.)

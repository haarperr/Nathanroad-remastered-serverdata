# pixel_drugsystem
Simple optimized, secured and easy conifgurable Drug System for ESX Framework on FiveM.

If you want to secure coordinates from Cache Dumpers then set Config.UseCoordsFromServer then you have to make Config.Zones as empty table in Config.lua and copy it content to Global variable named Zones in server.lua, now coordinates won't be visible for a player when client side dumped. It also prevents from Executing event more than one time after starting script so they can't use event second time :shrug:

If you find any bugs or you have suggestions then you can type to me on Discord (pixel57#0997) or Fivem Forum (Pixel2115)
